      	<p>Provence is a geographical region of southeastern France shaped like a giant wedge of quiche. From its sunburned crust, fanning out along the Mediterranean coast from the Camargue to Marseille, it stretches north along the Rhône Valley to Orange.</p>
      	<p>The Romans were here in force and left many ruins — some of the best anywhere. Seven popes, artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne, and author Peter Mayle all enjoyed their years in Provence. This destination features a splendid recipe of arid climate, oceans of vineyards, dramatic scenery, lively cities, and adorable hill-capping villages.</p>
        <p>There are many things to do while visiting Provence.  Let's explore this region by learning about it's history and events. </p>
